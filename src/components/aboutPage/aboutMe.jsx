                        &emsp;I am a junior at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School 
                        enrolled in the Computer Science program. As of present 
                        day, I am taking AP Computer Science A this year, which 
                        is a Java course. I started pursuing a future career path 
                        in Computer Science at the start of 2020. Despite the 
                        fact that this is a photography website, I enjoy 
                        programming/software development as well as weight 
                        lifting. Nonetheless, my admiration for photography 
                        remains present.
